    <h2> BIRIYANI </h2>
    <img>
    <p>Biryani is a mixed rice dish originating among the Muslims of South Asia. It is made with Indian spices, vegetables, rice, and usually some type of meat, or in some cases without any meat, and sometimes, in addition, eggs and potatoes. </p>
    <p>According to historian Lizzie Collingham, the modern biryani developed in the royal kitchens of the Mughal Empire (1526â€“1857) and is a mix of the native spicy rice dishes of India and the Persian pilaf.[12] Indian restaurateur Kris Dhillon believes that the dish originated in Persia, and was brought to India by the Mughals. </p>
